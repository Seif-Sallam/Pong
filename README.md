# Pong
This is an SFML C++ version of Pong with a twist. The more the time is passed, the smaller the pads become!

## Game Controlls

It is a 2-player game. The right pad is controlled by the arrow keys _Up and Down_ and the left pad is controlled by the buttons _W & S_.

## Compiling the project

This project was compiled and maintained on Linux Ubuntu 21.0. The project has a Makefile that compiles all the files needed for this project.

The required dependency is mainly [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Install SFML then run make at the root folder of the project. This will generate an executable file in the build folder _Build_.
